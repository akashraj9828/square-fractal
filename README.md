# square-fractal

This program uses simple algorithm called L algorithm and turtle drawing method



The L algorithm is simple this consist of 3 things 
1.
2.
3.

Using L algorithm we can st created an string of commands using F, L, R, [ and ]. 
Where F means move forward
R means rotate right 
L me as rotate left
[ means save current position
] means goto last saved position 

Then we read the string in which commands are written and then execute them one by one
I used turtle draw method to draw from that command
